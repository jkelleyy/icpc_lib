	 * This useful for computing area of a figure with straight lines
	 * Requirements:
	 * 		The lines in an order
	 * 
	 * Algorithm:
	 * 
	 * Go through the lines in an order.
	 * if it horizontal, take the y-coordinate times the length of the line (area under/above the line)
	 * if you are going left, multiply the area by -1
	 * sum up all the areas.
	 * take the absolute value
